        <h2>What is Term Life Insurance?</h2>
        <img src="../images/term-life-illustration.png" alt="Term Life Insurance Illustration" class="image">
        <p><strong>Term Life Insurance</strong> is a type of life insurance that provides coverage for a specific period, or "term," typically ranging from 10 to 30 years. If you pass away during the term, your beneficiaries receive a death benefit. Term Life Insurance is often the most affordable type of life insurance and is ideal for those who need coverage for a specific period, such as until their children are grown or their mortgage is paid off.</p>

        <h2>How Does Term Life Insurance Work?</h2>
        <img src="../images/how-term-life-works.png" alt="How Term Life Insurance Works Illustration" class="image">
        <p>Term Life Insurance is straightforward and easy to understand. Here’s how it works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Coverage Period:</strong> You choose the length of the term (e.g., 10, 20, or 30 years) when you purchase the policy. The policy remains active as long as you pay the premiums.</li>
            <li><strong>Premium Payments:</strong> You pay regular premiums (monthly, quarterly, or annually) to keep the policy active. Premiums are typically fixed and do not increase during the term.</li>
            <li><strong>Death Benefit:</strong> If you pass away during the term, the insurance company pays the death benefit to your designated beneficiaries.</li>
            <li><strong>No Cash Value:</strong> Unlike Whole Life or Indexed Universal Life Insurance, Term Life Insurance does not accumulate cash value. It provides pure protection at an affordable cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Renewability:</strong> Some Term Life policies allow you to renew the policy at the end of the term, although the premiums may increase.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Average Costs and Coverage Options</h2>
        <img src="../images/term-life-costs.png" alt="Term Life Insurance Costs and Coverage" class="image">
        <p>The cost of Term Life Insurance depends on several factors, including your age, health, the length of the term, and the coverage amount. Here’s an overview of what you can expect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Premiums:</strong> Monthly premiums for a Term Life policy can range from $20 to $50 for a $500,000 policy for a healthy individual in their 30s.</li>
            <li><strong>Coverage Amounts:</strong> Term Life policies are available with coverage amounts ranging from $50,000 to several million dollars, depending on your needs and financial situation.</li>
            <li><strong>Level Premiums:</strong> Most Term Life policies offer level premiums, meaning your premium payments remain the same throughout the term.</li>
            <li><strong>Policy Length:</strong> Common term lengths include 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 years. Choose a term that aligns with your financial obligations, such as the length of your mortgage or the time until your children are financially independent.</li>
        </ul>

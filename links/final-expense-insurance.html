            <li><strong>Guaranteed Payout:</strong> Upon your passing, your beneficiaries receive a payout, typically ranging from $5,000 to $25,000, which they can use to cover final expenses.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax-Free Benefit:</strong> The payout from a Final Expense Insurance policy is generally tax-free, allowing your loved ones to use the full amount for necessary expenses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is Life Insurance?</h2>
        <img src="../images/life-insurance-illustration.png" alt="Life Insurance Illustration" class="image">
        <p><strong>Life Insurance</strong> is a contract between you and an insurance company, where the insurer agrees to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money upon your death in exchange for premium payments. Life insurance provides financial protection to your loved ones, ensuring they are supported in the event of your passing.</p>

        <h2>How Does Life Insurance Work?</h2>
        <img src="../images/how-life-insurance-works.png" alt="How Life Insurance Works Illustration" class="image">
        <p>Life Insurance policies work by providing a death benefit to your beneficiaries upon your passing. Here’s a basic overview of how it works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Premium Payments:</strong> You pay premiums to the insurance company on a regular basis (monthly, quarterly, or annually) to keep the policy active.</li>
            <li><strong>Death Benefit:</strong> Upon your death, the insurance company pays out the death benefit to your designated beneficiaries.</li>
            <li><strong>Policy Types:</strong> There are different types of life insurance policies, each with its own features and benefits, including Term Life, Whole Life, and Indexed Universal Life (IUL).</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Some life insurance policies offer additional features, such as cash value accumulation, policy loans, and more.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Life Insurance</h2>
        <img src="../images/types-of-life-insurance.png" alt="Types of Life Insurance" class="image">
        <p>There are several types of life insurance policies, each designed to meet different financial needs and goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Term Life Insurance:</strong> Provides coverage for a specific period (e.g., 10, 20, or 30 years). If you pass away during the term, your beneficiaries receive the death benefit. Term Life is often the most affordable type of life insurance.</li>
            <li><strong>Whole Life Insurance:</strong> A permanent life insurance policy that provides coverage for your entire life. Whole Life Insurance includes a cash value component that grows over time, offering both a death benefit and a savings element.</li>
            <li><strong>Indexed Universal Life (IUL) Insurance:</strong> A type of permanent life insurance that offers flexibility in premium payments and death benefit amounts. The cash value in an IUL policy grows based on the performance of a market index, such as the S&P 500.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Average Costs and Coverage Options</h2>
        <img src="../images/life-insurance-costs.png" alt="Life Insurance Costs and Coverage" class="image">
        <p>The cost of life insurance varies depending on the type of policy, your age, health, and the coverage amount you choose. Here’s an overview of what you can expect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Term Life Insurance:</strong> Monthly premiums can range from $20 to $50 for a $500,000 policy for a healthy individual in their 30s.</li>
            <li><strong>Whole Life Insurance:</strong> Premiums are higher due to the permanent coverage and cash value component. Expect to pay between $100 and $300 per month for a $250,000 policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Indexed Universal Life (IUL) Insurance:</strong> Premiums are flexible, and you can adjust them based on your financial situation. Typical costs range from $100 to $500 per month, depending on coverage and cash value accumulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Coverage Amounts:</strong> Life insurance policies can be tailored to your needs, with coverage amounts ranging from $50,000 to several million dollars.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits of Life Insurance</h2>
        <img src="../images/life-insurance-benefits.png" alt="Life Insurance Benefits" class="image">
        <p>Life Insurance offers several key benefits that make it an essential part of financial planning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Financial Security:</strong> Provides peace of mind knowing that your loved ones will be financially protected in the event of your death.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax-Free Death Benefit:</strong> The death benefit is typically paid out tax-free to your beneficiaries.</li>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My journey began in a small Christian school, where I spent my elementary years learning the values that would shape me. Transitioning to public school for middle and high school was a significant shift, and it was during these years that I found solace and strength on the football field, playing from 1st through 8th grade. My life took a pivotal turn when my parents divorced around the age of 13 or 14—a challenging time that would later fuel my determination to overcome.
As I progressed through high school, I took on the challenge of college classes at my local junior college while still attending high school. At that time, I had a strong interest in psychology, driven by a deep desire to help others through tough times.
Midway through high school, I transitioned to online schooling, long before the world would become familiar with it during the COVID-19 pandemic. This change allowed me to focus on my studies and, as a result, I graduated half a year early. However, I decided to take a year and a half off before pursuing further education.
When I returned to college, my path took an unexpected turn. I chose to study Plant Science instead of psychology. This decision was sparked by an essay I wrote during one of my psychology classes. We were asked to imagine ourselves as something other than human. I chose a plant—resilient, adaptable, and always growing back no matter the circumstances. This was a trait I deeply admired, especially during a time when I struggled to overcome life's challenges. I wanted to work with plants in a way that would still allow me to help people, and that’s when the idea of working with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) was planted.
As I neared the completion of my Associate's degree, financial realities set in. It was difficult enough to pay for community college—how would I manage the cost of a four-year university? That’s when I made another life-changing decision: I joined the United States Marine Corps.
Joining the Marines was one of the best decisions I ever made. I loved everything about it—the camaraderie, the sense of purpose, and the job itself. I served as a Network Administrator for a newly established company, MWCS-18, which hadn't even had its activation ceremony when I joined. I had the unique opportunity to help build and lay the foundation of a new company, an experience few Marines can claim. I was stationed in Hawaii, a place that became more than just a duty station—it became my home.
Unfortunately, my time in the Marines was cut short by an injury that forced me to separate. Leaving the Marine Corps was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. I left thinking I could easily find a job in the networking field, but reality hit hard. Every job required certifications I didn’t have, and I didn’t have the luxury of time to study for them—I needed to work to survive. So, I pivoted once again and earned my Life Producer License for the state of California.
I moved from job to job until I found my current role as an Insurance Broker. While I enjoy helping people secure their financial futures, my passions for networking, coding, and working with plants still burn brightly. My journey has been anything but linear, but each twist and turn has shaped who I am today—a resilient, adaptable individual, much like the plant I wrote about years ago.

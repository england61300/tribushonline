        <h2>What is Whole Life Insurance?</h2>
        <img src="../images/whole-life-illustration.png" alt="Whole Life Insurance Illustration" class="image">
        <p><strong>Whole Life Insurance</strong> is a type of permanent life insurance that provides coverage for your entire lifetime, as long as premiums are paid. Unlike Term Life Insurance, Whole Life Insurance includes a cash value component that grows over time, offering both a death benefit and a savings element. This type of policy is ideal for those seeking lifelong coverage with additional financial benefits.</p>

        <h2>How Does Whole Life Insurance Work?</h2>
        <img src="../images/how-whole-life-works.png" alt="How Whole Life Insurance Works Illustration" class="image">
        <p>Whole Life Insurance offers both a death benefit and a cash value component. Here’s how it works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Permanent Coverage:</strong> Whole Life Insurance provides lifelong coverage, meaning your beneficiaries are guaranteed a death benefit whenever you pass away, as long as premiums are paid.</li>
            <li><strong>Premium Payments:</strong> Premiums are typically higher than those for Term Life Insurance, but they remain fixed for the life of the policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Cash Value Growth:</strong> A portion of your premium payments goes into a cash value account that grows over time. This cash value can be accessed through loans or withdrawals during your lifetime.</li>
            <li><strong>Dividends:</strong> Some Whole Life policies are eligible to receive dividends from the insurance company, which can be used to increase the cash value, reduce premiums, or purchase additional coverage.</li>
            <li><strong>Guaranteed Payout:</strong> The death benefit is guaranteed and is typically tax-free to your beneficiaries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Average Costs and Coverage Options</h2>
        <img src="../images/whole-life-costs.png" alt="Whole Life Insurance Costs and Coverage" class="image">
        <p>The cost of Whole Life Insurance is higher than Term Life due to its permanent nature and cash value component. Here’s what you can expect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Premiums:</strong> Monthly premiums for Whole Life Insurance typically range from $100 to $300 for a $250,000 policy, depending on your age, health, and the insurance provider.</li>
            <li><strong>Coverage Amounts:</strong> Whole Life policies offer coverage amounts ranging from $50,000 to several million dollars, tailored to your financial needs and goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Level Premiums:</strong> Premiums are level, meaning they do not increase over time, making it easier to budget for your insurance costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Cash Value Accumulation:</strong> The cash value component grows at a guaranteed rate, providing a source of funds that can be accessed during your lifetime.</li>
            <li><strong>Dividends:</strong> Participating Whole Life policies may pay dividends, which can be used to enhance the policy’s value.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits of Whole Life Insurance</h2>
        <img src="../images/whole-life-benefits.png" alt="Whole Life Insurance Benefits" class="image">
        <p>Whole Life Insurance offers several key benefits that make it an attractive option for those seeking permanent coverage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lifelong Coverage:</strong> Provides peace of mind knowing that your beneficiaries will receive a death benefit whenever you pass away.</li>
            <li><strong>Cash Value Growth:</strong> The cash value component offers a savings element that grows over time and can be accessed during your lifetime.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax Advantages:</strong> The death benefit is typically paid out tax-free, and the cash value grows on a tax-deferred basis.</li>
            <li><strong>Dividends:</strong> Participating policies may pay dividends, which can be used to increase the policy’s value or reduce out-of-pocket costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Estate Planning:</strong> Whole Life Insurance can be used as part of an estate plan to ensure your heirs receive the full value of your estate.</li>
        </ul>
